			<h1>Space Trail</h1>
			<p>The year is 2148, 300 years after pioneers conquered the Old West. SOL-3 (formerly known as Earth) has been overcrowded for years, and SOL-4 (formerly known as Mars) is on its way toward filling up as well. It's only been half a century since we made contact with the other races of the galaxy, but since then, humanity has developed Faster-Than-Light travel (with a tiny bit of help from the scientists of LUH-17). Now it's time for the New Frontier (though many are quick to point out that it's not the Final Frontier).</p>
			<p>You and your family are planning a mission to help colonize THX-11. The earliest forerunners have already arrived, and it's time for the second wave of colonists. The path is dangerous, however, filled with nebulas, black holes, and space pirates. Will you and your family make it to THX-11 alive?</p>
